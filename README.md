## socialLinks.js

JavaScript library to create all those social links for you, without you needing to do anything but include this script, jQuery, and perhaps an element to hold the links. The script will pull the header, description, URL and even an image (for Pinboard) for you.

Attribution decay is very common on social networks like Pinterest and Tumblr because they emphasize the source within the network (re-pinned/blogged from...) rather than the creator. By offering links to post to your readers' social network accounts, you can influence, if not control, what is posted about your content, including links to your original work.

1. Include the file on the web page.
2. Create an element where the links should appear with the id **socialLinksParent**
3. Update the object's configuration to your preferences.
